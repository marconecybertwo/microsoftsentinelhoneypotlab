<h1>Microsoft Sentinel Honeypot Lab</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a project that aims to provide a platform for detecting live hacks coming from all over the world and gathering data based on findings. It consists of a small lab build that can be deployed on any device with minimal requirements. 
<br />


<h2>The lab build includes the following components</h2>
- Components

- A data visualizer that displays the data collected by the data collector in an interactive and intuitive way, such as graphs, charts, maps, etc. The data visualizer also allows users to explore and manipulate the data using various features and functions, such as filters, zooms, annotations, etc.

- A hacking monitor that tracks and analyzes the hacking activities happening on the internet, such as attacks, breaches, vulnerabilities, etc. The monitor also alerts and notifies the users about the live hacks that are relevant and interesting to them, such as by location, type, severity, etc.

- A data collector that captures and stores the data generated by the hacking monitor, such as hack details, sources, targets, impacts, etc. The data collector also provides an interface for querying and analyzing the data using various tools and methods, such as SQL, Python, R, etc.
